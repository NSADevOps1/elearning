Creating a platform for an e-learning company
The company the wants to take advantage of a Government programme to retrain graduates into IT. 

Currently they donâ€™t have a robust platform that can take care of all the needs of their students. They want to build a more robust platform that can orchestrate their docker applications and also that can scale. 

We're using Terraform to build this environment. They have containerised all their applications and all their images are stored in ECR. 

We're building a code for DEV environment, TEST environment, STAGING environment and PROD Environment.

The Application the ECS will orchestrate is Nginx server.

Using Jenkins to build the pipeline/Jenkinsfile to deploy the code to AWS platform.
